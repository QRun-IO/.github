# QRun-IO Community Health Files

This repository contains the default community health files for the QRun-IO organization. These files apply to all repositories in the organization that don't have their own versions.

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|  
| [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) | Contribution guidelines |
| [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) | Community code of conduct |
| [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) | Security vulnerability reporting |
| [ISSUE_TEMPLATE/](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) | Issue templates for bug reports and feature requests |
| [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) | Pull request template |
| [profile/README.md](profile/README.md) | Organization profile (shown on org page) |

## How It Works

GitHub automatically uses these files as defaults for all repositories in the organization. Individual repos can override any file by creating their own version.
